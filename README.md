# Page growth/trend report from Google Analytics Data API v1 and GA4 Property

[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) makes it easy to view your page counts for an arbitrary date range, but what is more difficult is comparing these results to an older window of data to see:

* Which pages have grown/lost in absolute counts
* Which pages are trending growth/loss in terms of their percent (up-and-comers)

The [GA4PageGrowth.py3](GA4PageGrowth.py3) script gathers the latest window of GA4 data (default=30 days), and compares it to the 30 days preceding it to show you which pages have grown/lost in absolute terms as well as percent.

This can help you fine-tune your content creation, and invest in content that is showing the largest potential.

# Google Analytics GA4 is future model (UA deprecated)

This script uses the latest [Google Analytics Data API v1](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1) (GA4 using propertyId) data source, and not the deprecated [Google Analytics Reporting API v4](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4) (UA using viewId), which is scheduled to be turned off in June 2023.

The Python [Analytics Data API](https://googleapis.dev/python/analyticsdata/latest/index.html) client library is used for GA4 data access.

## Prerequisites

* Google GCP
  * [Create GCP Project](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/quickstart/service-py) using this quickstart
  * [Enable Analytics Data API for project](https://console.cloud.google.com/start/api?id=analyticsreporting.googleapis.com&credential=client_key) enable Analytics Data API for this project
  * Create Google Service Account (GSA), download json key for auth later
* Google Analytics
  * Link Google Analytics to your web site, decorate site pages with tracker
  * Admin > "Property" > Propery Settings, copy down your propery ID for reporting later
  * Admin > Account Access Management, add GSA in 'Viewer' role so it can query data


## Run report against Google Analytics GA4

### Prepare environment

```
# make sure python3 venv is installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common python3 python3-dev python3-pip python3-venv curl git -y

git clone https://github.com/fabianlee/google-analytics-py3-page-growth-trend-report.git
cd google-analytics-py3-page-growth-trend-report

# create virtual env for isolated libs
python3 -m venv .
source bin/activate

# install module dependencies into virtual env
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Invoke Script

```
# place json key into this directory

# invoke report generator
./GA4PageGrowth.py3 <jsonKeyFile> <analyticsPropertyID>

# width of report window can be changed (default=30 days)
./GA4PageGrowth.py3 <jsonKeyFile> <analyticsPropertyID> -d 14
```
