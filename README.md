# Page growth/trend report from Google Analytics Data API v1 and GA4 Property

[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) makes it easy to view your page counts for an arbitrary date range, but what is more difficult is comparing these results to an older window of data to see:

* Which pages have grown/lost in absolute counts
* Which pages are trending growth/loss in terms of their percent (up-and-comers)

The [GA4PageGrowth.py3](GA4PageGrowth.py3) script gathers the latest window of GA4 data (default=30 days), and compares it to the 30 days preceding it to show you which pages have grown/lost in absolute terms as well as percent.

This can help you fine-tune your content creation, and invest in content that is showing the largest potential.

If you would rather use pandas DataFrame to analyze this data instead of raw dictionaries, see my other github project [ga4-pandas-py3-page-growth-trend](https://github.com/fabianlee/ga4-pandas-py3-page-growth-trend)

# Google Analytics GA4 is future model (UA deprecated)

This script uses the latest [Google Analytics Data API v1](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1) (GA4 using propertyId) data source, and not the deprecated [Google Analytics Reporting API v4](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4) (UA using viewId), which is scheduled to be turned off in June 2023.

The Python [Analytics Data API](https://googleapis.dev/python/analyticsdata/latest/index.html) client library is used for GA4 data access.

## Prerequisites

* Google GCP
  * [Create GCP Project](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/quickstart/service-py) using this quickstart
  * [Enable Analytics Data API for project](https://console.cloud.google.com/start/api?id=analyticsreporting.googleapis.com&credential=client_key) enable Analytics Data API for this project
  * Create Google Service Account (GSA), download json key for auth later
* Google Analytics
  * Link Google Analytics to your web site, decorate site pages with tracker
  * Admin > "Property" > Propery Settings, copy down your propery ID for reporting later
  * Admin > Account Access Management, add GSA in 'Viewer' role so it can query data


## Run report against Google Analytics GA4

### Prepare environment

```
# make sure python3 venv is installed
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common python3 python3-dev python3-pip python3-venv curl git -y

git clone https://github.com/fabianlee/google-analytics-py3-page-growth-trend-report.git
cd google-analytics-py3-page-growth-trend-report

# create virtual env for isolated libs
python3 -m venv .
source bin/activate

# install module dependencies into virtual env
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Invoke Script

```
# place json key into this directory

# invoke report generator
./GA4PageGrowth.py3 <jsonKeyFile> <analyticsPropertyID>

# width of report window can be changed (default=30 days)
./GA4PageGrowth.py3 <jsonKeyFile> <analyticsPropertyID> -d 14
```
